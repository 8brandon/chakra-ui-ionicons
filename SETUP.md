# Setup Info

(Notes to keep around from the tsdx bootstrap)

## TSDX

This project was bootstrapped with (TSDX)[https://tsdx.io/].

### Rollup

TSDX uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) as a bundler and generates multiple rollup configs for various module formats and build settings. See [Optimizations](#optimizations) for details.

## Commands

TSDX scaffolds your new library inside `/src`, and also sets up a [Parcel-based](https://parceljs.org) playground for it inside `/example`.

The recommended workflow is to run TSDX in one terminal:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Then run the example inside another:

## The Website

```bash
npm start # start tsdx in watch mode
cd website
npm i # or yarn to install dependencies
npm start # or yarn start
```

The default example imports and live reloads whatever is in `/dist`, so if you are seeing an out of date component, make sure TSDX is running in watch mode like we recommend above. **No symlinking required**, we use [Parcel's aliasing](https://parceljs.org/module_resolution.html#aliases).

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.

### Deploying the Website

The Playground is just a simple [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) app, you can deploy it anywhere you would normally deploy that. Here are some guidelines for **manually** deploying with the Netlify CLI (`npm i -g netlify-cli`):

```bash
cd example # if not already in the example folder
npm run build # builds to dist
netlify deploy # deploy the dist folder
```

Alternatively, if you already have a git repo connected, you can set up continuous deployment with Netlify:

```bash
netlify init
# build command: yarn build && cd example && yarn && yarn build
# directory to deploy: example/dist
# pick yes for netlify.toml
```

### Jest

Jest tests are set up to run with `npm test` or `yarn test`.

#### React Testing Library

We do not set up `react-testing-library` for you yet, we welcome contributions and documentation on this.

### Bundle analysis

Calculates the real cost of your library using [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) with `npm run size` and visulize it with `npm run analyze`.

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions

Two actions are added by default:

- `main` which installs deps w/ cache, lints, tests, and builds on all pushes against a Node and OS matrix
- `size` which comments cost comparison of your library on every pull request using [`size-limit`](https://github.com/ai/size-limit)

## Publishing to NPM

We recommend using [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np).
